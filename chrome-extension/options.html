		This action will delete your current seed.  You can then
		click the Seed Pass toolbar icon to import or create a new seed.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		You should only do this for one of the following reasons:
		<ol>
			<li>You wish to create a new seed because you think your old seed has been compromised.  
			Creating a new seed will cause all websites to have a different password.</li>
			
			<li>You want to import a different seed which was created on a different computer or at a past time.</li>
			
			<li>You wish to erase the seed from this computer.  Erasing it in this way is usually sufficient. 
			 If you want to be extra thorough it's a good idea to also delete the Seed Pass extension afterwards.</li>			
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The following action <b>cannot be undone</b>!  Do not proceed unless you have a backup copy of the current 
		seed otherwise,
		any passwords created from the old seed will be <b>lost forever</b>.
